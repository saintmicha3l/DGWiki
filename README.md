### Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork the repository**  
   Use GitHub’s *Fork* button to create your own copy of the DGWiki repository.

2. **Add your content under your user directory**  
   - Create a directory at:`users/<your_username>/`. There is a template folder available named `TEMPLATES` for new users. READ THE FUCKING `README.md` IN THE ROOT OF THE `YOURUSERHANDLE` DIRECTORY FOR THE FUCKING LOVE OF GOD. thanks. 
   - Include a `README.md` file. This acts as the landing page for your section. Your `README.md` must include your Public Key. This verifies who you say you are and your work.
   - Organize your work into subdirectories such as:
     - `ctf/`
     - `bug_bounty/`
     - `research/`
     - `projects/`
   - Formatting and structure may be adjusted as needed to maintain Docsify compatibility.

   **Docsify compatibility guidelines:**
   - Every directory should contain a `README.md`.
   - Use lowercase names and underscores (`_`) for files and folders.
   - Keep Markdown clean and readable.
   - You may create your own `_sidebar.md` to manage navigation within your section.

3. **Update `_sidebar.md` if required**
   - If you add new sections, ensure they are referenced in the sidebar.
   - Preserve the `Home` and `Users` sections for consistent site navigation.
   - Docsify uses this file to generate the left-hand navigation menu.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Push your changes to your fork.
   - Open a pull request against the main DGWiki repository.
   - Include a concise description of what you added or modified.
