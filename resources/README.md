# Resources

Welcome to the **Resources** page.

This is a **community-curated collection of links, tools, references, and external material**, organized by category to make finding what you need as painless as possible. The goal here isn’t to be pretty or exhaustive for the sake of it—it’s to be *useful*.

You’ll find resources covering a wide range of topics, including security research, CTFs, bug bounty work, development tools, documentation, learning material, and assorted rabbit holes worth falling into.

Use the **navigation sidebar** to browse categories and jump directly to what you’re looking for. If you don’t see a category that fits, it probably means it hasn’t been added yet—feel free to contribute.

This page is intentionally collaborative. Links may evolve, move, or get replaced as better resources appear. Quality, relevance, and practical value matter more than polish.

If it helps you learn something, solve a problem, or go deeper down the stack, it belongs here.
