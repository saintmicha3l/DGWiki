# Bug Bounty Platforms

The following platforms host **legal, authorized bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure programs**. These programs allow security researchers to test real‑world applications and infrastructure within defined scopes and receive recognition or monetary rewards for valid findings.

These platforms are commonly used to:
- Practice real‑world web and application security
- Build professional vulnerability reports
- Earn bounties or reputation
- Transition from CTFs into real engagements

> Always read and respect program scope, rules, and disclosure policies. Out‑of‑scope testing can lead to account bans or legal consequences.

### Notes

- Bug bounty work requires **clear reporting, reproducibility, and professional communication**.
- Start with **VDP or low‑complexity scopes** before chasing high‑value targets.
- The ability to write a clean report often matters more than the exploit itself.

Bug bounty isn’t about “hacking companies” — it’s about helping them fix what they didn’t see.
