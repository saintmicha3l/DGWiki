### Notes

- Most platforms support **multiple languages**, including Python, C, C++, JavaScript, Go, Rust, and Java.
- Mixing **challenge‑based** platforms with **project‑based** learning produces the best results.
- These resources pair exceptionally well with CTFs, scripting tasks, and tool development.

Strong code isn’t about syntax — it’s about thinking clearly and building things that work.
