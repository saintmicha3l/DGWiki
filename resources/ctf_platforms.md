# CTF Platforms

The following platforms provide **hands‑on Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges** and also allow you to **download intentionally vulnerable virtual machines or images** for local practice and lab setups.

These platforms are commonly used to:
- Practice exploitation techniques in controlled environments
- Build local home labs
- Prepare for certifications and competitions
- Learn realistic attack paths and privilege escalation chains

> All platforms listed here are intended for **legal, authorized learning environments only**.

## Downloadable Vulnerable Machines

- [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com)  
  One of the largest collections of intentionally vulnerable virtual machines. Most machines are CTF‑style and include walkthroughs. Images are available in VirtualBox and VMware formats.

- [Exploit Exercises](https://exploit-exercises.com)  
  Classic exploitation‑focused virtual machines such as **Fusion**, **Nebula**, and **Protostar**. Fully downloadable and designed for low‑level exploitation practice.

- [Metasploitable](https://information.rapid7.com/metasploitable-download.html)  
  A classic intentionally vulnerable VM maintained by Rapid7. Commonly used for exploitation practice and introductory CTF training.

- [OWASP Broken Web Applications Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-broken-web-applications/)  
  A curated collection of vulnerable web applications packaged as a downloadable VM for hands‑on web exploitation practice.

- [DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)](https://dvwa.co.uk)  
  A deliberately vulnerable web application distributed as a VM and Docker image. Frequently used for web exploitation training and CTF preparation.

## Online Platforms with Offline / Retired Labs

- [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com)  
  Offers live labs, retired machines, and downloadable VM files (subscription required). Focuses on realistic attack chains and modern exploitation techniques.

- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)  
  Interactive CTF‑style rooms with guided learning paths. Some rooms and labs provide downloadable VM images for local practice.

- [Offensive Security – Proving Grounds](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/)  
  Official vulnerable machines from Offensive Security. Machines are downloadable and designed for standalone exploitation and certification preparation.

- [PentesterLab](https://pentesterlab.com)  
  Provides downloadable vulnerable systems and exercises with a focus on web exploitation, privilege escalation, and real‑world attack scenarios.

## Hybrid Platforms & Training Labs

- [Root‑Me](https://www.root-me.org)  
  Offers both online challenges and downloadable virtual machines covering web, network, and system exploitation.

- [Hacking‑Lab](https://www.hacking-lab.com)  
  Includes downloadable vulnerable images and structured CTF‑style exercises, often used for formal training and competitions.

### Notes

- Many platforms provide **retired or standalone machines** specifically for offline practice.
- Building a **local lab** allows unrestricted experimentation without time pressure.
- Walkthroughs exist for many machines, but solving them blind is where the learning happens.

CTFs aren’t about flags — they’re about learning how systems break when humans make assumptions.
