# Exploits

This section contains links to **well‑known exploit databases, repositories, and frameworks** used for *authorized* penetration testing, security research, and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

These resources catalog **publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, proof‑of‑concept exploits, and exploitation techniques** that are commonly referenced during assessments, labs, and controlled environments.

>  All tools and data listed here are intended for **legal, authorized use only**.

## Exploit Databases & Archives

- [Exploit Database (Exploit‑DB)](https://www.exploit-db.com)  
  One of the most widely used public exploit archives. Maintained by Offensive Security and tightly integrated with tools like `searchsploit`.

- [Packet Storm Security](https://packetstormsecurity.com)  
  A long‑running security archive hosting exploits, advisories, tools, and whitepapers across multiple platforms.

- [CXSecurity](https://cxsecurity.com)  
  Community‑driven vulnerability and exploit database with a focus on proof‑of‑concept material and disclosure history.

- [0day.today](https://0day.today)  
  Exploit archive and vulnerability marketplace. Content availability and quality varies — approach cautiously and verify sources.

---

## Vulnerability Databases & References

- [MITRE CVE Database](https://cve.mitre.org)  
  The canonical source for CVE identifiers and standardized vulnerability metadata.

- [NVD – National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov)  
  U.S. government vulnerability database providing CVEs, severity scores, and references to known exploits and advisories.

---

## Exploitation Frameworks

- [Metasploit Framework](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework)  
  A comprehensive exploitation framework containing thousands of exploit modules, payloads, and post‑exploitation tools used in labs, engagements, and CTFs.

---

## GitHub Exploit Repositories

- [Exploit‑DB (GitHub Mirror)](https://github.com/urcuqui/exploit-database)  
  A public GitHub mirror of Exploit‑DB containing thousands of exploits, proof‑of‑concepts, and shellcode across platforms and languages. This dataset powers `searchsploit`.

- [0xMarcio/cve](https://github.com/0xMarcio/cve)  
  Community‑curated collection of **recent CVEs with associated proof‑of‑concept exploits**, useful for research and testing.

- [pwnfuzz/POCs](https://github.com/pwnfuzz/POCs)  
  A collection of proof‑of‑concept exploits for modern vulnerabilities. Useful as reference material and learning examples.

- [SirCryptic/PoC](https://github.com/SirCryptic/PoC)  
  Repository of PoC exploits tied to known CVEs. Suitable for quick testing and study.

---

## Exploit Discovery & Search Tools

- [Sploitus](https://sploitus.com)  
  Exploit search engine aggregating data from multiple public sources, including Exploit‑DB and GitHub.

- [SearchSploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit)  
  Offline exploit search tool for Exploit‑DB, commonly used during penetration tests, labs, and CTFs.

### Notes

- Exploits should always be tested in **controlled lab environments** or under explicit authorization.
- Many exploits require **modification, chaining, or environmental conditions** to function correctly.
- Understanding the vulnerability matters more than running the exploit blindly.

Knowing *why* an exploit works is more valuable than knowing *that* it works.
